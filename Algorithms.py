Linear Search

1. Linear search - two dimensional list of “n x m” elements

Given a two dimensional list of “n x m” elements, write a function to
count occurrences of a given key.
The function should also return a matrix of the position of a key in
the 2 dimensional list.
For example, given the following list:
Mylist = [[1,4,7],[4,5,2],[6,4,8]]
and a key, e.g. key = 4
The output should be
3, [[0, 1], [1, 0], [2, 1]]
# 3 occurrences of number 4 in positions: 0,1, 1,0 and 2,1
What is the complexity of the linear search in the 2 dimensional
array?

Bubble Search

Develop BubbleSort (hint)
o It is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly
swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order.
o Implement a simple bubble sort algorithm!
