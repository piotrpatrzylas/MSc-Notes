Four "V" of Big Data:  
- volume (data size)  
- velocity(speed of change)  
- variety(data types)  
- veracity(bias, noise, anomaly)  

Standard deviation - how data is spread out:  
Sx = sqrt(sum(xi - mean) over (n-1)) [unbiased: n-1]  
Example:  
x = 3,1,3,9
mean = 4
sqrt((3-4)^2 + (1-4)^2 + (3-4)^2 + (9-4)^2 / n or n- 1)= sqrt(1+9+1+25)/3 = 3.46 (unbiased)  

Covarience - dimensional quantity to check relationships between x and y:  
Sxy = sum(xi-mean)*(yi-mean)/n-1  
Example:  
x = 3, 1, 3, 9  
x mean = 4  
y = 5, 2, 4, 1  
y mean= 3  
(3-4)*(5-3)+... = -10/4 = -2.5  

Bayes Rule:  
P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)  

SIMPLE LINEAR REGRESSION:
y = b0 + b1X  
y - response  
b0, b1 - parameters (b0 is y intercept)  
x - predictor  

RSS = Residual Sum of Squares, used to find Best fit line:  
- mean residual = 0  
- the residual sum of squares is minimised for best fit  
formula:  
b1 = (x-x_mean)*(y-y_mean) over (x-x_mean)^2  
b0 = y_mean - b1*x_mean
